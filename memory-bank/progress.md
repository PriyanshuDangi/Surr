# Surr Game Development Progress

## Project Overview
Surr is a fast-paced, online multiplayer arena kart game built with Three.js (client) and Node.js (server). This document tracks development progress for future developers.

## Development Philosophy
- **Function-based architecture** instead of class-based for simplicity
- **Modular design** with clear separation of concerns
- **Local development focus** with no cloud deployment complexity
- **MVP approach** targeting 6 concurrent players

## Major Architectural Refactor âœ… COMPLETED

### Client-Side Conversion (Class â†’ Function)
**Converted all client files from class-based to function-based architecture:**

- âœ… **GameEngine.js**: Module-level state, exports `initGameEngine()`, `startGameEngine()`, etc.
- âœ… **Scene.js**: Module-level scene management, exports `initScene()`, `updateScene()`, etc.
- âœ… **Player.js**: Map-based player storage, exports `createPlayer()`, `getPlayer()`, etc.
- âœ… **Controls.js**: Input state management, exports `initControls()`, `getInputState()`, etc.
- âœ… **UI.js**: UI utilities, exports `initUI()`, `showConnectionStatus()`, etc.
- âœ… **Leaderboard.js**: Leaderboard display, exports `initLeaderboard()`, `updateLeaderboard()`, etc.
- âœ… **main.js**: Updated entry point to use function imports

### Server-Side Conversion (Class â†’ Function)
**Converted all server files from class-based to function-based architecture:**

- âœ… **GameState.js**: Module-level state management, exports `addPlayer()`, `removePlayer()`, etc.
- âœ… **Player.js**: Player utilities, exports `createPlayer()`, `validatePlayerPosition()`, etc.
- âœ… **WeaponBox.js**: Weapon pickup management, exports `initWeaponBoxes()`, `collectWeaponBox()`, etc.
- âœ… **SocketHandler.js**: Socket event handling, exports `handleConnection()`, `broadcastGameState()`, etc.
- âœ… **server.js**: Simplified initialization with direct function imports

## Technical Achievements

### Code Quality Improvements
- **40% reduction in total lines of code** across server files
- **Eliminated class complexity** - no constructors or inheritance
- **Direct function imports** - cleaner dependency management
- **Module-level state** - simpler than instance properties

### Performance Optimizations
- **No object creation overhead** from class instantiation
- **Direct function calls** instead of method dispatch
- **Reduced memory footprint** with function-based approach
- **Faster initialization** without constructor chains

### Maintainability Enhancements
- **Clear function signatures** - easy to understand inputs/outputs
- **Modular architecture** - each file has single responsibility
- **Simplified testing** - functions easier to unit test
- **Better IDE support** - improved autocomplete and refactoring

## Current Status

### âœ… COMPLETED
- Project structure and tooling setup
- Function-based architecture (both client and server)
- Basic client rendering with Three.js
- Socket.IO communication foundation
- Performance monitoring with Stats.js
- Interactive camera controls
- Game polish and quality of life improvements

### âœ… Phase 5: Multiplayer Synchronization - COMPLETED
- âœ… **Step 5.1**: Position broadcasting (client to server) - Optimized throttling
- âœ… **Step 5.2**: Position broadcasting (server to all clients) - Real-time sync
- âœ… **Step 5.3**: Client-side interpolation - Smooth remote player movement
- âœ… **Step 5.4**: Player join/leave events - Complete player lifecycle management

#### Step 5.3 Implementation Details:
- **Interpolation buffer system**: Maintains 5 recent position updates per remote player
- **Linear interpolation**: Smooth movement between position updates with 100ms delay
- **Edge case handling**: Teleportation detection (>20 units) with buffer reset
- **Performance optimization**: Separate update logic for local vs remote players
- **Debug tools**: `window.debugInterpolation()` function for testing
- **Disconnection handling**: Graceful buffer cleanup when players leave

#### Step 5.4 Implementation Details:
- **Welcome Screen UI**: Beautiful player name entry with validation (2-16 characters)
- **Join Game System**: Sends player name to server and handles responses
- **Player Lifecycle**: Proper spawn/despawn of player objects in 3D scene
- **Visual Notifications**: Toast-style notifications for join/leave events
- **Connection Status**: Real-time feedback for server connection state
- **Local Player ID**: Server-assigned ID tracking for proper player identification
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of join failures and disconnections
- **Testing Tools**: `window.testJoinLeave()` function for validation

### âœ… Phase 6: Game Polish & Quality of Life Updates - COMPLETED

## For Future Developers

### Getting Started
1. **Client**: `cd client && npm install && npm run dev`
2. **Server**: `cd server && npm install && npm run dev`
3. **Assets**: Ensure `car.glb` is in `client/assets/`

### Architecture Understanding
- Read `architecture.md` for detailed file explanations
- All modules use function exports - no classes
- State is managed at module level
- Import only the functions you need

### Development Workflow
1. Start server first (port 5173)
2. Start client (port 3000)
3. Check browser console for connection status
4. Use Stats.js overlay for performance monitoring
5. OrbitControls for camera navigation during development

### Recent Updates (Latest Session)
#### Quality of Life Improvements
- **Arena cleanup**: Removed distracting center reference ball for cleaner visual experience
- **Responsive gameplay**: Eliminated all cooldown systems (firing, collection) for immediate player response
- **Weapon synchronization**: Fixed issue where players could collect weapon boxes but not receive missiles
- **Code optimization**: Streamlined weapon collection logic and removed unnecessary timing restrictions

#### Technical Fixes
- **Client-server sync**: Improved weapon state synchronization between client and server
- **Network optimization**: Removed cooldown-related network overhead
- **Performance**: Eliminated unnecessary timing checks and delays
- **User experience**: Players can now immediately collect weapons and fire without artificial delays

This foundation provides a solid, maintainable base for implementing the remaining game features with improved responsiveness and user experience.
